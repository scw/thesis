Organization
 - Background on shipping
 - Fusing the volunteered data
 - Cover relevant ecological linkages: strikes, noise, groundings [ballast, pollution
 - Future: networks, simplified representations of the data

Setting the stage
 - Why Shipping? Halpern 2008 work characterized cumulative human impacts to marine environment: 17 habitat types 20 threats. Of the 20 threats, fishing, climate change and shipping are the major three contributors to the global scores.
 - Fishing and climate change have received much of the scientific focus, but shipping should be addressed and accounted for as well.

What is Shipping?
 - Primarily, trade: 90% of world goods, 1.8T of goods shipped each year. 
 - Baltic dry index is a leading economic indicator
 - The importance of shipping means that data related to shipping is valuable
 - Leaves a gap in the data picture for scientific inquiry
 
What are the ecological effects?
 - Invasive Species
 - Emissions
 - Direct Pollution

 + Ship Strikes
 + Noise Pollution
 + Groundings

Shipping in Context
 - Shipping is also important in a broader context, as move toward holistic management of the oceans. To do effective Ecosystem-based management, we need foundational data on anthropogenic use, and we have little information on shipping.  

What data exists?
 - VOS: describe
 - AIS: describe
 - records on individual vessels

What does this work do?
 - Links AIS and VOS data to individual vessels.
 - focus here on producing per-class vessel movement estimates.

How?
 - Use record linkage to build a robust database of known vessels
 - fuzzy reasoning to merge records
 - map these linked records to our observations
 - build TRACKS of observed movement patterns for individual vessels.

Lots of traits used to filter and improve data:
 - speed
 - on / off land
 - combine attributes to validate those vessels (and observations) we actually want to process.
