@article{DeVries2010a,
abstract = {In this paper we apply a selection of alignment measures, such as dynamic time warping and edit distance, to the problem of clus- tering vessel trajectories. Vessel trajectories are an example of moving object trajectories, which have recently become an important research topic. The alignment measures are defined as kernels and are used in the kernel k-means clustering algorithm. We investigate the performance of these alignment kernels in combination with a trajectory compression method. Experiments on a gold standard dataset indicate that compres- sion has a positive effect on clustering performance for a number of align- ment measures. Also, soft-max kernels, based on summing all alignments, perform worse than classic kernels, based on taking the score of the best alignment.},

@article{Kawaguchi2004,
abstract = {The aim of this research is to realize a computerized, intelligent, and autonomous system to support navigation for multiple ocean-going vessels that share the same sail- ing course like a transport convoy. Detecting and evad- ing other clusters in close proximity is one of the most important tasks in navigation as contacting these will po- tentially cause serious risks to the ship. Focus of this pa- per is to investigate computational capabilities added to the so-called ship cluster behavior model of our previous work. Enhancement is made to predict a risky situation and to guide for multiple ship clusters, enabling them to move safely and avoid contact with each other. Such im- provement is critical, especially when the traffic becomes congested with a number of clustered ship groups moving to distinctive directions. Foundations for and preliminary experimental results of this study are presented},

@unpublished{Mascaro2010,
abstract = {In recent years, electronic vessel tracking has provided abundant data on vessel movements to surveillance authorities. Researchers have begun looking at the use of this data for anomaly detection using a wide variety of data mining techniques. Here we tackle anomaly detection with Bayesian Networks, training them with real world AIS data and producing models at two different time scales â€” both moment to moment and for the track as a whole. The networks also incorporate additional real world data, including weather, vessel details and details about vessel interactions. We find that the generated networks are quite easy to examine and verify despite incorporating a large number of variables; that combining models at the two different scales improves performance in a variety of cases; and, ultimately, that Bayesian Networks prove a promising approach to anomaly assessment and detection.},

abstract = {We present an integrated and multidisciplinary approach for analyzing the behavior of moving objects. The results originate from an ongoing research of four different partners from the Dutch Poseidon project (Embedded Systems Institute (2007)), which aims to develop new methods for Maritime Safety and Security (MSS) systems to monitor vessel traffic in coastal areas. Our architecture enables an operator to visually test hypotheses about vessels with time-dependent sensor data and on-demand external knowledge. The system includes the following components: abstraction and simulation of trajectory sensor data, fusion of multiple heterogenous data sources, reasoning, and visual analysis of the combined data sources. We start by extracting segments of consistent movement from simulated or real-world trajectory data, which we store as instances of the Simple Event Model (SEM), an event ontology represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Next, we add data from the web about vessels and geography to enrich the sensor data. This additional information is integrated with the representation of the vessels (actors) and places in SEM. The enriched trajectory data are stored in a knowledge base, which can be further annotated by reasoning and is queried by a visual analytics tool to search for spatiotemporal patterns. Although our approach is dedicated to MSS systems, we expect it to be useful in other domains.},
