Things to create:

 - a diagram of the data glow between the various steps.
 - nice, high res maps that are suitable for displaying in a poorly lit room.
 - building out the connection to ECOLOGY
 - put together a slide on the work that I did with Megan and Steve
 - include an image from the NOAA cetatean & sound WG
