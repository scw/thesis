\chapter{Movement Modeling}
\label{sec:movement-modeling-appendix}

% XXX copy and paste job, include details here.... tools used? DETAILED APPROACH.
Each vessel track was rasterized to both an 90 arcsecond grid (\textasciitilde{}5.5km at the equator) and an equal area grid in the Hobo Dyer projection (Figure \ref{fig:eu-cargo-density}). The latter case assures that the density function is computed on grid cells representing the same area for each cell, unlike the geographic grid where area varies by latitude. A vessel is counted only once for each cell it passes through, as the focus here on overall movement patterns, and this criteria helps de-emphasize vessels with limited movement. Each raster vessel track was combined using simple map algebra to produce density maps for both the AIS and VOS data, for each of our vessel classes. % XXX Oliver: A passing cargo ship is comparable to a ferry crisscrossing the same spot continuously every day?  Not that you should do this, but somebody might wonder.

Maps produced in ArcGIS and Quantum GIS.

gdal_rasterize did the rasterization step

gdal_add, custom python code combined the results

paralellized in Python.

% Bresenham's line algorithm used for rasterizing the tracks. Only counted a ship moving through a single cell once to get movement patterns v. dockage

% XXX built spatial indexes and reordered the data on disk to match for performance.


\chapter{Record Linkage}
\label{sec:record-linkage-appendix}

The Jaro-Winkler formula is defined in two steps. First, The Jaro distance, $d_j $, is defined as:

% good code-based illustration at: http://www.gettingcirrius.com/2011/01/calculating-similarity-part-2-jaccard.html

\begin{equation}
  d_j = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    0 & \text{if }m = 0 \\ 
    \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{m}{|s_1|} + \frac{m}{|s_2|} + \frac{m-t}{m}\right) & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

Where:

m = number of matching patterns
t = number of transposed characters
|s1| = length of first string
|s2| = length of second string

Two characters are considered matching when they are no further apart than:
\begin{equation}
  \left\lfloor\frac{\max(|s_1|,|s_2|)}{2}\right\rfloor-1
\end{equation}

The second component, added by Winkler, preferentially weights strings which match from the beginning, set by the prefix length $ l $.  Thus, the Jaro-Winkler distance is defined:

\begin{equation}
  d_w = d_j + (\ell p (1 - d_j))
\end{equation}

Where $ p $ is a constant scaling factor to adjust for the strength of common prefixes. In its usage here, $ p = 0.1 $ and $ l = 4 $.
