    No work is the act of one alone, and this thesis is no exception. It would not have been possible without the thoughts and guidance of many. I owe the idea to Ben Halpern, without whom I wouldn't have had worked on interesting marine problems, or even thought twice about shipping. The whole Gaines lab, including Steven Gaines himself, have been tremendously supportive, even when it required rose-colored glasses to see the connections between our work. Robert Warner was gracious enough to join my committee on short notice, and provide insightful context. Krzysztof Janowicz kindly connected this work with the geographic world. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) provided me with the intellectual and technical means to carry out this work, including generous use of its computing resources. NCEAS staff Mark Schildhauer and Jim Regetz helped me see new ways of marrying technology to science. Feedback from NCEAS postdocs, including Jennifer Balch, Jai Rangnathan, Carrie Kappel, and Darren Hardy have left this work richer. NCEAS staff member Ben Best has been a wonderful resource for understanding the ecological context of shipping. Megan McKenna and Steve Katz were gratious enough to share with me an application area, and taught me about how to intepret ship observations. The manuscript is improved thanks to the thoughtful and careful feedback of Oliver Soong. I am indebted to Dawn Wright, for seeing me through the fire, and supporting me through the transition between academia and industry. Thanks to my family and friends, for being there, even when they didn't understand what I was working on, or why anyone would care. And lastly, thanks to my fiancée, Jessica Phillips, who has helped me in too many ways to list.
