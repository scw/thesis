    No work is the act of one alone, and this thesis is no exception. This thesis would not be possible without the thoughts and guidance of many. I owe the idea to Ben Halpern, without which I wouldn't have thought twice about shipping. The whole Gaines lab, including Dr. Steven Gaines himself, have been tremendously supportive, even when it required rose-colored glasses to see the connections between our work. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) has provided me with both the intellectual and technical means to carry out this work. Mark Schildhauer and Jim Regetz have helped me see new ways of marrying technology to science. The feedback from NCEAS postdocs, including Jennifer Balch, Jai Rangnathan, Carrie Kappel, and Darren Hardy have left this work richer. NCEAS staff member Ben Best has been a wonderful resource for understanding the ecological context of shipping. Megan McKenna and Steve Katz were gratious enough to share with me an actual application area for this information, and taught me much about how to intepret ship-borne observations. The manuscript is improved thanks to the thoughtful feedback of Oliver Soong. I am indebted to Dawn Wright, for seeing me through the fire, and supporting me through the transition between academia and industry. Thanks to my family and friends, for being there, even when they didn't understand what I was working on, or why anyone would care. And lastly, thanks to my fiancée, Jessica Phillips, who has helped me in too many ways to list.
