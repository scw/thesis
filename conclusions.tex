As noted by Goodchild, ``changing technology and economics are moving map production from a system of unified central production to a local patchwork, and the old radial system of dissemination is being replaced with a complex network''\citep{goodchild1999cartographic}. By using quality assurance methods from both computer science and geography, such as record linage and geographic validation, we can filter unreliable inputs. The near future will involve global, real-time, high resolution ship data \citep{JonesGoogle2012,carson2012satellite}, but we continue to need methods which accommodate data curation and integration, and allow us to address specific hypotheses. This is a key appeal of volunteered information: some problems of uncertainty become tractable with sufficient observation volume, as we can evaluate the distribution directly instead of relying on sampling methods.


The future will include global AIS coverage \citep{JonesGoogle2012,carson2012satellite}, but methods to validate and integrate this data into a scientifically useful system do not yet exist. Here we have shown that by using VGI methods, we can incorporate many data dimensions and correct for multiple forms of error present in the data.

This work leaves much undone. True cost-path movements, accounting for vessel preference and barriers, will give us a way of understanding the relative value of different areas within the ocean to the shipping industry. An abstract network model, which incorporates the detailed movement model developed, would allow us to interact with this complex data in a much simpler way, and potentially lead to breakthroughs in marine spatial planning at regional scales. More immediately, these results can feed into understanding the anthropogenic sources of sound in the ocean, and improve models of ship strikes, by providing detailed, holistic speed data for much of the sea.

Recent calls for increased marine spatial planning at both the national and international level should be met with increased production of fundamental datasets required for effective planning. This work can help advancement of both marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management. This work can also help organizations like the IMO on more effective regulation of shipping, perhaps using insurance-based incentives to reflect environmental costs.

% The ship classifications should be derived riguously, perhaps directly relying on observation data such as those presented here~\citep{adams2011constructing}.
