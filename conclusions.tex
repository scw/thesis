\section{Conclusion}

% State what the data mean, link to question stated in the introduction

% - sumarize results/findings
% - put results into context
% - explain implications
% - link to future work + highlight shortcomings

The future will include global AIS coverage \cite{JonesGoogle2012,carson2012satellite}, but methods to validate and integrate this data into a scientifically useful system don't yet exist. Here we've shown that by using VGI methods, we can incorporate many data dimensions and correct for multiple forms of error present in the data.

The approach outlined here is in many ways just the beginning: logical next steps would be deriving true cost-path movement models for the ships, determining the predominant direction within each cell, and producing an abstract network model from the data.

% The ship classifications should be derived riguously, perhaps directly relying on observation data such as those presented here~\citep{adams2011constructing}.


% XXX XXX LIMITATIONS -- START HERE.

% phantom ships phenomena

% time saving meausure: reverse engineer it: START WITH WHAT WE Don't KNOW and what ISN'T RESOLVED
% - work it backward to what we DO HAVE.
%  - START WITH THE CONSTRAINTS FIRST...
%   - HOW WILL WE COORDINATE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, WHO SHOULD DO IT?
