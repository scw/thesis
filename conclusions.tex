\section{Conclusion}

% State what the data mean, link to question stated in the introduction

% - sumarize results/findings
% - put results into context
% - explain implications
% - link to future work + highlight shortcomings

The future will include global AIS coverage \cite{JonesGoogle2012,carson2012satellite}, but methods to validate and integrate this data into a scientifically useful system are nascent. By using a variety of VGI methods, here we've shown % XXX



% need methods to e data and integrate our understanding.

% XXX XXX LIMITATIONS -- START HERE.

% phantom ships phenomena

% time saving meausure: reverse engineer it: START WITH WHAT WE Don't KNOW and what ISN'T RESOLVED
% - work it backward to what we DO HAVE.
%  - START WITH THE CONSTRAINTS FIRST...
%   - HOW WILL WE COORDINATE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, WHO SHOULD DO IT?
