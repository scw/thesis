\section{Record Linkage}

Record linkage matched 30-50\% of each record source pair (Table \ref{table:ships-record-linkage-results}), and additional validation boosted this even further. That authoritative data are inconsistent points toward needing better unified and public identifiers than are currently exist.

After pairwise linkage, matched records were further cross-linked, % XXX HOW? create-ships-table.py contains the logic.
 to account for vessels appearing in multiple sources. The number of links per ship averaged 3.5 ($\mu = 3.49, \sigma = 0.828$), % XXX STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT? the vast majority only have 3-4 links. Tried fitting this data to a variety of distributions, it can be done, but for what end? the 'high' values really indicate errors, and these should be separated out to their relevant subships.
though this distribution is skewed by a handful of vessels which were linked to many vessels incorrectly.

\section{Geographic Validation}

The land-sea mask developed (Section \ref{sec:land-sea-mask}) was compared against each observation: is the point contained within a water body? However, this simple validation technique was insufficient to resolve many observations, which lie at the edge of the two classes when docked % XXX Oliver Do docked ships really belong in a shipping dataset anyway?
 and moving near shore % XXX Oliver How near shore?  Are there that many boats that actually travel in this zone?  I imagine Costa Concordia.
(Figure \ref{fig:longbeach-validation}). Due to this and other limitations, the observations 'on land' were retained for the rest of the analysis, but perhaps a better approach would be to apply a local density estimation on the vessels, and determine a mask based on thresholding the data. Instead, most of the on land observations were filtered by using our track generation rules, which by restricting vessel movements to a possible range, generally remove individual erroneous observations, but a more robust technique would be useful for systematic errors.

% XXX: how did we improve data quality by using geographic filtering? what does that tell us, and why does it matter?

\end{figure}

Ship speed is an important predictor for a variety of questions, but is challenging to represent spatially, as it is sensitive to the observation frequency in a particular location, along with accurate distance and time measurements. To get a general sense of ship speed, the speed distribution of each vessel class was examined, both through simple boxplots (Figure \ref{fig:vessel-speed-boxplot}), and through a more nuanced kernel density estimation (Figure \ref{fig:vessel-speed-density}). The density estimation shows that for many classes, distinct speed patterns are clearly visible. For example, support vessels, which include tugs and barges move much more slowly than high-speed transport vessels. Other classes are less distinct in speed signature: cargo and tanker vessels have surprisingly similar average speeds, though by breaking this down spatially (Figure \ref{fig:speed-ship-map}), we can see a more nuanced story.

\subsection{Density}

The density maps show the dramatically different movement structure of the major vessel classes: cargo, tankers and passenger ships all exhibit important differences in their movement.  % XXX XXX add new text to bulk this up.
