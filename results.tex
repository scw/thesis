\section{\textbf{Results}}
%A concise report of your results. A final report is not a lab log book, so you do not need to include details of every calculation or include every graph.  Most readers get bored if there are too many very similar graphs in a paper. The key requirement is to report all findings that relate directly to your goals and that will be referred to in the discussion.  

%Avoid having the text in the Results section be a simple list of each result or statistical test â€“ integrate, summarize, synthesize, and point out the most important messages you want your readers to take away from the paper.

% What really matters from what we've done?


% Include our graphs: each of our ship types, with two sets of plots: ship density, and ship speed.



% XXX: suggestion-- ships by season? just static results here, can do some dynamic stuff later.
