TODO
----

- write Jano to ask him for what specifically he'd like to see. Also, any reference material on trajectory clustering he found particularly useful (send on some of the articles I've found as well). EMAILED
- email Ben, send my edits by Friday, ask for changes by... Monday? Tuesday? Def need it back by Wednesday to make it all happen. EMAILED, will send Ben a draft by this evening. CAN'T GET TO IT, TOO BUSY THIS WEEK, BUMMER!

 - make the networks diagram showing diff transportation networks.
 - update the 'AIS' picture I made to be... more useful. include attributes, other things to get the information density up on this picture.


Feedback
--------

Jano:
 - provide more detail on what actually was done. Code, whatever, fine -- but include details. It can be in an appendix, but need to include information like cell size, processing techniques, and other details of what the heck you actually did. [Move some stuff from the methods into this appendix].

Robert:
 "It was actually kind of fun to read, even though the writing was crummy."
  - bad writing, interesting problem.

Ben: Talk was excellent. Need to take the things from the talk and drop them directly into the paper. Strikes, sound, ... discussion should be point by point on this stuff! GIT ER DONE

Images
------
 - Bivand's models of reality CUSTOMIZE FURTHER? ... did a little, would take lots of work to entirely recreate. RESPONDED, he in turn borrowed it from another publication (Borroughs, 1996). Included both in the citation line, should be good enough as is to include.

Copyright
---------
 - still need to handle copyright issues in the data, from all our sources. Some of the TOS conflict with my intended use, particularly an issue when it comes to redistribution; they aren't exactly Wikipedia on this front.
 - RAW AIS records are probably OK, even though the providers make a claim on the data... dig into this a little.
 - Ship ATTRIBUTES need some thinking about... how do we give attribution effectively?

Uncertainty
-----------

 - at a minimum, include our 'obs per area' figure to show what kind of density we have, what % of major world ports is sampled.
 - ports: of large ports in WPI, 112/155 (72.3%) had 100 or more unique vessels, and 187/357 (52.4%) of medium ports, we have AIS for much, but not all of the important near shore areas.

 - mention the difficiencies of some areas (why are we routing some data through land masses?)

DONE

LATEX:
 - PREVENT TABLE C.2 from being double spaced, takes up too much space and overflows page... DONE

 - FIX: rotated 9fold image? either shrink it to fit or rotate it correctly. SHRUNK it, but it looks strange. keep it small, and post a URL
    + Have 3x3 maps right now, each with a 2:1 h:w ratio, so the total image ratio is 6:3 which is inefficient on a 4:3 page.
    + 5.9"wx8.4"h is our 'drawable area' within a page, or 1.42 h:w ratio, not that far off of our 1.5 image ratio...SO, one trick would be to render image + caption, save out to SVG, fix up 'page' as we see fit in Inkscape, then supress the natural caption (but would still need it to show up in the Table of Images)
    + DONE, reshaped to map

 - Finish running Moran's I calculations on data layers to at least report that. DONE
