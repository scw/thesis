TODO
----

- write Jano to ask him for what specifically he'd like to see. Also, any reference material on trajectory clustering he found particularly useful (send on some of the articles I've found as well).

- email Ben, send my edits by Friday, ask for changes by... Monday? Tuesday? Def need it back by Wednesday to make it all happen.


Feedback
--------

Jano:
 - provide more detail on what actually was done. Code, whatever, fine -- but include details. It can be in an appendix, but need to include information like cell size, processing techniques, and other details of what the heck you actually did. [Move some stuff from the methods into this appendix].


Robert:
 "It was actually kind of fun to read, even though the writing was crummy."
  - bad writing, interesting problem.

Steve: Great talk, did a good job.

Ben: Talk was excellent. Need to take the things from the talk and drop them directly into the paper. Strikes, sound, ... discussion should be point by point on this stuff! GIT ER DONE

Images
------

 - Image copyright:
    + EBM diagram REDO? REMOVE
    + time geography picture REDONE from original, credited source
    + Nisbett's models of reality CUSTOMIZE FURTHER? ... did a little, would take lots of work to entirely recreate.
    + ADD record-workflow.pdf as part of methods. DONE
    
 - FIX: rotated 9fold image? either shrink it to fit or rotate it correctly. SHRUNK it, but it looks strange. keep it small, and post a URL 
    + Have 3x3 maps right now, each with a 2:1 h:w ratio, so the total image ratio is 6:3 which is inefficient on a 4:3 page.
    + 5.9"wx8.4"h is our 'drawable area' within a page, or 1.42 h:w ratio, not that far off of our 1.5 image ratio...SO, one trick would be to render image + caption, save out to SVG, fix up 'page' as we see fit in Inkscape, then supress the natural caption (but would still need it to show up in the Table of Images)


COPYRIGHT:
 - still need to handle copyright issues in the data, from all our sources.
 - RAW AIS records are probably OK, even though the providers make a claim on the data... dig into this a little.
 - Ship ATTRIBUTES need some thinking about... how do we attribute effectively?
  


Uncertainty
-----------

 - at a minimum, include our 'obs per area' figure to show what kind of density we have, what % of major world ports is sampled.
 - ports: of large ports in WPI, 112/155 (72.3%) had 100 or more unique vessels, and 187/357 (52.4%) of medium ports, we have AIS for much, but not all of the important near shore areas.

 - Finish running Moran's I calculations on data layers to at least report that.
 - 

mention the difficiencies of some areas (why are we routing some data through land masses?)
